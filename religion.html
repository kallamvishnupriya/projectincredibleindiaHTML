        <h1><b><i>Religions in India</i></b></h1>
         <p><b>India is often called the land of spirituality because it is the birthplace of several of the world’s major religions and home to many others. Here, faith is not just a personal belief but an integral part of daily life, influencing festivals, traditions, art, and social values. The country’s religious diversity reflects its philosophy of “unity in diversity”, where multiple faiths coexist and shape its cultural identity.</b></p>
