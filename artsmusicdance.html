        <h1><b><i>Art, Music, and Dance</i></b></h1>
        <p><b><i>India’s artistic heritage is as colorful and diverse as its landscapes. From the rhythmic grace of classical dances to the vibrant beats of folk performances, art in India is a celebration of life, spirituality, and storytelling. Music flows through every corner of the country — whether in the form of ancient ragas, devotional hymns, or the catchy tunes of cinema. Painting, sculpture, and architecture reflect centuries of cultural fusion, while theatre and cinema keep traditions alive in new forms.</i></b></p>

         <P>Classical dance in India is more than entertainment — it is a centuries-old art form that combines storytelling, spirituality, and discipline. Rooted in Natya Shastra, an ancient Sanskrit text on performing arts, these dances were traditionally performed in temples as offerings to the gods. They use a combination of mudras (hand gestures), abhinaya (expressions), and nritta (pure dance movements) to narrate stories, often drawn from epics like the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Puranas.</P>

         <p>Folk dances are the heartbeat of India’s rural and regional life. They are performed during festivals, weddings, harvest celebrations, and community gatherings, often in open spaces under the sky. Unlike classical dances, which follow strict rules from ancient texts, folk dances are more spontaneous, energetic, and connected to the everyday lives of people. They reflect local traditions, costumes, music, and stories, passed down through generations.</p>

         <p>Cinema is one of India’s most popular and influential forms of art and entertainment. Known as Indian cinema, it produces more films than any other country in the world, in multiple languages and genres. Movies are more than just entertainment here — they are a cultural phenomenon that shape fashion, music, and even social attitudes.</p>
